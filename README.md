# GraduationProj
This is a repository for undergraduate students' graduation project of 2022

I'll make some notes here while I'm learning DFO(Dispersive Flies Optimisation), so you can follow my notes to go on pre-study on this project.

First of all, you should make youself clear that the reason we choose DFO is that DFO was introduced with the intention of analysing a simplified swarm intelligence algorithm with the fewest tunable parameters and components. And the first research on DFO is to compare with other swarm intelligence algorithm, about the error, the efficiency and the diversity measures, those aspects can judge the quality of a swarm algorithm somehow.

(1)You can view the explaination of DFO on Wikipedia(Url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersive_flies_optimisation), it's a fairly simple swarm algorithm for a layman. While reading this wiki, you shoule pay attention to the pseudocode, making it understandable to you, repeating the pseudocode till you can write it yourself. When you can achieve this, you get DFO for sure.

(2)If you get troubled while solving steps above, you can connect DFO with PSO, I think they are quite in same in some way, if you still in trouble after doing these, go ask me straightly.

Then comes the code part, I've prepared some primary codes for you to get start, include DFO, Multi-DFO etc. Through these code you can learn not just algorithm but Python, too.

(1)You should start from DFO, this is the primary version of the algorithm of your graduation project, so you have to understand it completely.
